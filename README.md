# Seattle Sweeps Open Data Repository
This is a public, open data repository containing data on Seattle's policies of displacement against unhoused people, commonly known as sweeps. All documents and files were originally created by city officials and obtained by public disclosure requests to the city of Seattle under Washington state's Public Records Act (RCW 42.56).

**Why create this repository?**
The goal of this repository is create an easily accessible public portal for accessing quantitative data about Seattle's sweeps policies. Over the years, I have recieved inquiries from researchers, advocates and fellow journalists about this data. This feels like the best way to make minimize gatekeeping while also making the data easy to access and understand.
<br>
Because these documents were created with no intent for publication, they likely contain errors. I have done my best to compile a master list of sweeps, removing duplicates and other events like inspections. However, it is unlikely we will never know the true number of encampment removals that have been conducted, so these counts should be taken as an estimate with a range of error.
<br>
While politicians choose to hide data sets like these from the public, they make dashboards to track how few unhoused people's encampments remain standing. I reject the premise that we should let those in power decide what information you get to see. Look through the data and write your own narrative on how Seattle treats its residents who are forced to live on the street.

**What's in the repository?**
This repository is broadly divided several subfolders. Within each subfolder is a short read me document, explaining the documents inside. Perhaps the first place to go in the repository is the file "Sweeps2008-2023_Combined.csv," which contains a master list of all encampment sweeps. There is also a table of sweeps by year, as well as corresponding excel versions of the spreadsheets. In "SweepLogsCode.R," I outline the methodology I use to combine the lists, as they were recorded by different teams with varying record keeping styles. In "SweepVisualizations.R," I create visualizations used for Gossip Guy posts. 
<br>
The raw data for the master list of sweeps is found in the RemovalLogs folder, along with a .csv version of the files. The ComplaintLogs folder contains data on complaints submitted to the city of Seattle about encampments and homeless people. The SweepCosts folder contains information about the budget for the agencies/cross-departmental formations tasked with carrying out sweeps, including the Navigation Team and the Unified Care Team.

**Who created this repository?**
I (Guy Oron) created this repository. I am a Seattle-based writer and journalist, currently working for Real Change as its staff reporter. You can find me and my work on my various social media channels as well as my newsletter Gossip Guy (gossipguy.net).
<br>
I want to give special thanks to Aaron Burkhalter, Real Change's former editor and staff reporter, for providing me the spreadsheet of data for sweeps between 2008 and 2017. If he had not retrieved that list, it would have probably been deleted permanently.
