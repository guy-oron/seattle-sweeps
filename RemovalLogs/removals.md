**Removal (i.e. Sweeps) Logs**
<br>
This is the heart of the repository, containing logs of homeless encampment removals dating back to 2008. After receiving the raw .xlsx logs, they were converted and simplified to .csv form based on the different iterations of the city's sweeps team (for example, the record keeping systems for the Navigation Team differed from those of the Unified Care Team).
